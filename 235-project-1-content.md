# The A-Maze-ing Game

It's a 3D Maze Game

## Game Concept
The A-Maze-ing game is a puzzle-centric maze game where players will traverse numerous maze levels with a focus on puzzle solving to open up paths

## Genre
Genre: Puzzle Maze

## Platform
Platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux, Raspberry Pi, Nintendo 64, Comodore 64, Sega Dreamcast

## Story
The story of the A-Maze-ing game is simple. You are Johnathan McBunderSnatch. You woke up one morning and were no longer in your room, but instead in a giant maze! You must now make your way through multiple levels of mazes in hopes of escaping and getting back home!

## Aesthetic
The game will have a retro 90s first person PC game aesthetic, in the same vein as games such as Wolfenstein 3D and Doom (1993).

## Gameplay
### Mechanics
The game consists of maze levels in which the player must find their way to a marked exit. Along the way they may find traps, puzzles, and enemies that wish to hunt them down and stop them

### Controls
Use WASD to move! (A & D are for strafing) and use any standard computer mouse or laptop nipple to move the first person camera!

### New User Experience
Players will be slowly introduced to new puzzle mechanics as they progress throughout the levels, later on said mechanics may be combined to create more complex puzzles

### Player Learning
Players must learn to solve simple puzzles to open up new paths as well as how to properly traverse and map out routes through a maze. This is so players can properly avoid or even lure enemies away from certain paths, allowing them to circle back and progress further

## About the Developer
![Project 1 File Structure](images/selfpic.jpg "Project 1 File Structure") 

Hi there! My name is Sijal Jaradat, and I'm a second yeard Game Design and Development student at RIT! As my choice of major might suggest, I love video games! I'm a huge fan of platformers and action/adventure games. I'm hoping that through my IGME235 class I can learn to better handle Web Development with HTML and CSS, especially since most Game Dev students go into co-ops that focus on Web Development! When I graduate however, I hope to be making games for Nintendo, be it in the US or Japan.

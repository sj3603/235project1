The story of the A-Maze-ing game is simple. You are Johnathan McBunderSnatch. You woke up one morning and were no longer in your room, but instead in a giant maze! You must now make your way through multiple levels of mazes in hopes of escaping and getting back home!

This game will look like a game

## Gameplay

- 5 whole A-Maze-ingly mind boggling levels!
- A timer in each level to make sure you're not playing for too long when you have homework!

It'll have a cool title screen that will make you want to play!

### Player Learning
Text boxes with instructions anyone?

## About the Developer
![Project 1 File Structure](images/selfpic.jpg "Project 1 File Structure") 

Hi there! My name is Sijal Jaradat, and I'm a second yeard Game Design and Development student at RIT! As my choice of major might suggest, I love video games! I'm a huge fan of platformers and action/adventure games. I'm hoping that through my IGME235 class I can learn to better handle Web Development with HTML and CSS, especially since most Game Dev students go into co-ops that focus on Web Development! When I graduate however, I hope to be making games for Nintendo, be it in the US or Japan.

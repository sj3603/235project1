### IX. About the Developer
Hi there! My name is Sijal Jaradat, and I'm a second yeard Game Design and Development student at RIT! As my choice of major might suggest, I love video games! I'm a huge fan of platformers and action/adventure games. I'm hoping that through my IGME235 class I can learn to better handle Web Development with HTML and CSS, especially since most Game Dev students go into co-ops that focus on Web Development! When I graduate however, I hope to be making games for Nintendo, be it in the US or Japan.
